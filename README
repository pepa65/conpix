===============

display your images in a 256 color xterm!

export TERM=xterm-256color before usage

needs the following libraries
ncurses
lepton (sometimes called liblept)
tiff
png

how to compile: run ./build.sh

(the Makefile is auto-maintained by eclipse and somehow misconfigured 
atm)

LICENSE: GNU GPL v3

made with eclipse CDT (managed build)

the flickering at the end is caused by restoring the original colors, so you can keep on working with your xterm.
