- lepton (aka liblept aka leptonica)
- tiff
- png

AUTOMATED LIB INSTALL
---------------------
OS X: get macports and run: sudo port install leptonica tiff libpng ncurses

debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev libncurses5-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev

COMPILATION

(the Makefile is auto-maintained by eclipse and somehow misconfigured atm)

the flickering at the end is caused by restoring the original colors, so you can keep on working with your xterm.
